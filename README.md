This is a program that parses through financial documents (e.g. 10-Q's, 10-K's) and extracts 'Earnings per Share', however it may appear within the document. The parser prioritizes basic EPS over diluted, and non-GAAP over GAAP results.

Future iterations will have additional figures to parse for, and will feature more dynamic regex matching than is currently implemented.
